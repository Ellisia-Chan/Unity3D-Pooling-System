## Unity3D-Pooling-System

This repository explores different approaches to implementing pooling systems in Unity3D for optimization purposes.

### Contents:

The repository contains three branches, each demonstrating a different pooling system implementation:

- **[Generic-Pooling-System](https://github.com/Ellisia-Chan/Unity3D-Pooling-System/tree/Generic-Pooling-System)**:  This branch showcases a generic pooling system implementation that can be used for various object types. 
- **[Custom-Pooling-System](https://github.com/Ellisia-Chan/Unity3D-Pooling-System/tree/Custom-Pooling-System)**:  This branch presents a custom-built pooling system tailored for specific needs.
<!-- - **[Unity-Built-in-Pooling-System](https://github.com/your-username/Unity3D-Pooling-System/tree/Unity-Built-in-Pooling-System)**: This branch demonstrates the use of Unity's built-in Object Pooling system. -->

### Usage:

This repository serves as a learning resource and is designed to help you understand:

- **The benefits of using a pooling system in Unity3D.**
- **Different ways to implement a pooling system.**
- **The advantages and disadvantages of each approach.**

### Getting Started:

1. **Choose a branch:** Select the branch corresponding to the pooling system you want to explore (e.g., `Generic-Pooling-System`).
2. **Review the code:** Examine the code within the chosen branch to understand how the pooling system is implemented.
3. **Experiment:** Modify the provided examples or create your own scenarios to test the effectiveness of each pooling system.

### Contribution:

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or enhancements to the existing implementations, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
